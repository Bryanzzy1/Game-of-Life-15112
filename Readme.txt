Description:
The project is an interactive simulation based on cellular automata, focusing on Conway’s Game of Life. In this simulation, the user interacts with a grid of cells that evolve according to simple rules. The player controls a “green square” that can move within the grid, with the objective of avoiding cell interactions that lead to its death. The game includes basic features such as zooming, pausing, and restarting the simulation.
The project adds a difficulty system that adjusts the speed at which the cells evolve, creating a more challenging experience as the player progresses. In addition, future cell states are indicated by highlighting cells in red based on the user’s choice and progression, showing where they will move or evolve next. This allows the player to strategize their movement. To further assist the player, there will be options where all valid movement areas are displayed in blue, indicating where the player can move safely. Lastly, game levels will be random. There will be a level design system where the cells will be placed at random based on a rule set that will allow the player to have fun and be challenged. The player will win if all cells reach a dead state or if the timer ends when they are alive.
